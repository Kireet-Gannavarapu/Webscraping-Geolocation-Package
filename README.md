# Webscraping-Geolocation-Package

This pack contains the two python modules I created while doing my thesis on "Processing text and geolocation data for location based services". 

The First module contains a class containing methods for geolocation.


The Second module contains a set of web scraping functions. The web scraping functions are focused on extracting news headlines and articles from various news websites. It also contains a class which can be used for Text Summarization and Sentiment Analysis. 

To use the module, you need to install the following python libraries which are used by the functions I created. You can do this either by pip or conda

1. requests

2. BeautifulSoup4

3. spacy

4. textblob

5. selenium

6. chromedriver-binary

NOTE: while installing chromedriver-binary, it installs the latest chromedriver version. So, if your chrome version is not 84, install chromedriver-binary==yourchromeversion
